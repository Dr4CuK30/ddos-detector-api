Analyze the following messages to identify patterns associated with a potential DDoS attack on IoT devices. Consider characteristics such as irregular traffic spikes, abnormal device behavior, repeated requests from similar sources, and unusual access patterns. For each message, respond only in the JSON format below: {\"message_id\": \"unique_identifier\", \"probability\": \"[number]%\",\"justification\": \"brief explanation for the evaluation\" }. Init in 0 of probability. If I provide new messages, incorporate them into the ongoing analysis. Always respond only real analysis. If the data do not look like real logs answer probability 0 and say it in the justification. If the message is empty, answer the same data of the previous message.Always respond with only JSON, no additional comments or explanations.
