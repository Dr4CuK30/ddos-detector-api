Act as an IoT traffic monitoring system and analyze the following messages to identify 
patterns associated with a potential DDoS attack on IoT devices. Consider characteristics 
specific to IoT, such as irregular traffic spikes, abnormal device behavior, repeated 
requests from similar sources, and unusual access patterns. For each message, provide a 
probability in the standardized format 'Probability: [number]%' of a DDoS attack based on 
these factors and other typical IoT attack indicators. Analyze the messages continuously, 
but only ask the probabilities until I send the word 'STOP' and only ask those probabilities. 
Use the sample messages below for the analysis and briefly justify your evaluation for each one
